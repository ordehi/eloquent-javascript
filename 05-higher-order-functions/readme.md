# Higher-Order Functions

> A large program is a costly program, and not just because of the time it takes to build. Size almost always involves complexity, and complexity confuses programmers. Confused programmers, in turn, introduce mistakes (_bugs_) into programs. A large program then provides a lot of space for these bugs to hide, making them hard to find.

Code that expresses a solution in a vocabulary taht corresponds to the problem being solved is usually more likely to be correct. For example:

```js
sum(range(1, 10));
```

Expresses the sum of a range in terms with which we're familiar, rather than in loops and counters.

## Abstraction

> Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level.
